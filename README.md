OBS: run in safari if possible, only works in full screen.


I have made a multiplayer game, with three possible players to enter. It is based on an old school sumo wrestling game, in which you had to push your opponents of an arena set in the sky. This was my original inspiration, but I also became inspired by the international Womens day, which is why I changed the characters form sumo wrestlers to international politicians (if you can call them that). In the game, it is the establishment of white, incompetent male leaders of the world, Putin and Trump, vs. a really cool woman in my opinion, Michelle Obama. The objective is for the players controlling what I have dubbed "the white guys" to fend of the closing in on equality presented by Michelle, by pushing her off the arena. For Michelle, the purpose is to show the old establishment that it is time for a change, and throw them off the arena. 


Code-wise I have worked with groups in creating my characters, because it was something I wanted to try, and something which made it easier to make them push each other about. Groups to me seems to be sort of similar to arrays and classes, perhaps a mix, since they hold some characteristics applied to a group of sprites. 


I also used classes to create what was supposed to be clouds in the background. In the end, I found it very difficult, and ended up following a Shiffman tutorial, tweaking it here and here. This helped me understand the concept further, and also created to clouds I wanted. The clouds all move randomly about behind the arena and are spawned at random locations within a certain parameter. The characteristics of object-oriented programing to me is to think of what you want to create as being objects. With these objects, you can assign them some properties, maybe through a class should you want to use these properties many times over. I think it is a way of thinking about programing. 


Making real life things into computer representations, and consequently thinking of them as objects can, however, also be problematic in my opinion. We can only recreate so much of something, that it is never actually a true representation of its real counterpart. This means selecting what is important, what constitutes something. This is down to those who make it, the programmers. This actually made me (further) understand the importance of diversity, especially in the field of programing, in order to create colorful representations, not just seen through the eyes of a certain selection of people. 
In the Grand Theft Auto games, human beings are walking around on the street. In this game, it is possible to do all sorts of horrible things to these people, like shot them dead. So if we think about it, what constitutes a human in this game: they can walk, run, punch and die. This is not an accurate representation of what a human being is. It is flat. Me personally, I can accept that in videogames, because I know it is not a real representation of life - but for some people, things like this (perhaps not as extreme) might come to affect their view of the world. Which, obviously, is bad.
